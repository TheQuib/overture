# Snipe-IT

Just keeping this here as its easier for myself to find and reference again.

## Setting up

You can find a setup guide straight from the one who provided the help in the first place from [David Alecrim](https://github.com/comoser) and his [snipe-it-docker-compose repository](https://github.com/comoser/snipe-it-docker-compose).

Be sure to give it a start and follow him!
